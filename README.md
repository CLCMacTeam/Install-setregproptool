Install-setregproptool
======================

Supports OS X 10.7 and newer.

Perl script to install 'setregproptool', Apple's OS X Firmware Security command line tool.

Note:

This perl script functions as before on OS X Yosemite (10.10). Be aware that starting with OS X 10.10 a new command line binary is included at the path of /usr/sbin/firmwarepasswd on the default installation of the OS, which you may want to use instead of setregproptool, depending on your needs.

The setregproptool command line binary is still included with OS X Yosemite's'Firmware Password Utility' application (available when booted from the Recovery partition system).
